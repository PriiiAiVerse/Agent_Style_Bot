 🧠 AI Agent Perspective

This notebook is designed with **agentic AI systems** in mind — that is, LLMs acting as decision-makers, assistants, or creative copilots. It supports:

- Prompt Engineering: Fine-tune instructions using temperature, repetition_penalty, and max tokens.
- Controlled Generation: Encourage determinism or creativity based on task goals.
- Memory-Efficient Loading: Use on modest GPUs with 4-bit quantization.
- Scalability: Integrate into larger systems with text pipelines or memory-based agents.

Use this as a core component in:
- 🔍 Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- 🤖 Chatbots and autonomous agents
- 📝 Creative writing and content synthesis tools
- 🛠️ DevOps or code generation copilots

Hardware

✅ A GPU with CUDA support (ideally 16GB+ VRAM)

🧠 Enough memory to load and run large models

-----

### 🔧 Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate bitsandbytes

```


💡 Ensure you have a CUDA-enabled GPU and PyTorch with GPU support.

🎯 Sample Generation Parameters

| Parameter            | Value | Description                             |
| -------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| `temperature`        | `0.7` | Lower = more focused, higher = creative |
| `repetition_penalty` | `1.1` | Prevents repetition                     |
| `max_new_tokens`     | `512` | Controls output length                  |
